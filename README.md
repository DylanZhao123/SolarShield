# SolarShield: Advanced Space Weather Intelligence System

**Protecting Critical Infrastructure from Solar Events**

SolarShield is a comprehensive space weather monitoring and prediction platform that combines real-time data visualization with advanced machine learning to provide early warnings for solar flares, geomagnetic storms, and their impacts on critical infrastructure.

**Live Demo:** [SolarShield Application](https://solarshield.lovable.app/)  
**Built for:** NASA Space Apps Challenge - Data Visualization Track

## Project Overview

### Mission
Protecting over $10 billion in annual infrastructure damage from space weather events through intelligent early warning systems and predictive analytics.

### Problem
Solar storms can destroy satellites ($150M+ per incident), cause power grid blackouts, disrupt aviation routes ($100K+ per reroute), and interfere with GPS systems. Current monitoring systems lack accessible, real-time intelligence for infrastructure operators.

### Solution
SolarShield provides a dual-component system:
1. **Interactive Web Platform** - Real-time 3D visualizations and monitoring dashboards
2. **AI Prediction Engine** - Machine learning models for space weather forecasting
